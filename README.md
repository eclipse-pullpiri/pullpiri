# PULLPIRI

The main goal of PULLPIRI project is to develop an efficient vehicle service
orchestrator framework to realize the potential benefits of cloud native
technologies for in-vehicle services and applications. In this direction,
PULLPIRI shall ensure the activation of pre-defined use case scenarios or
policies in a well-organized and streamlined fashion depending upon the various
contexts of vehicle status, environment, connected devices and service
requirements. PULLPIRI shall enable the deployment of vehicle scenarios and
policies in short development cycle by reducing the development lead time. In
addition, it provides necessary management framework for the deployment of
micro services as per the requirements of vehicle applications and thus saving
the integration costs, time, and efforts.

## Features

- **Package Service on Cloud**  
: Compose an application by combining services  
: Define service relationships, select execution location  
: Application Model Structure (Redundant Structure, Monitoring, Proxy, Etc.)

- **Service Orchestrator on Vehicle**  
: Execute scenarios depending on vehicle status  
: Determination of Service Transition Time (Start, Stop, Restart, Switching, Etc.)  
: Manager text-defined scenarios and policies (Supports UX updates after release)

## Out of Scope

The PULLPIRI project does not cover several features, including implementations
for basic controlling services like launch, stop, create, or delete, deployment
or retrieval of workloads from a cloud registry, management of
non-containerized services, and functional areas supported by general container
runtime and systemd.

## Based Projects

PULLPIRI project has a plan to support several projects as core orchestrator.
Current version of PULLPIRI could be running based on this project.
