//! State Machine Implementation for PICCOLO Resource State Management
//!
//! This module implements the core state transition logic for Scenario, Package, and Model resources
//! according to the PICCOLO specification. It provides efficient data structures and algorithms
//! for managing state changes and enforcing the defined state transition tables.
//!
//! # Architecture Overview
//!
//! The state machine follows a table-driven approach where each resource type (Scenario, Package, Model)
//! has its own transition table defining valid state changes. The system supports:
//! - Conditional transitions based on resource state
//! - Action execution during state changes
//! - Health monitoring and failure handling
//! - Backoff mechanisms for failed transitions
//!
//! # Usage Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! let mut state_machine = StateMachine::new();
//! let state_change = StateChange { /* ... */ };
//! let result = state_machine.process_state_change(state_change);
//! ```
